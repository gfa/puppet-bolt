# Filters are how fail2ban detects mischief in logs. They contain regular
# expressions that should catch bad activity and identify the IP that is doing
# this activity.
#
# @summary Setup a filter for fail2ban
#
# @api public
#
#
# @example defining filter for jenkins
#   fail2ban::filter { 'jenkins':
#     failregexes => [
#       # Those regexes are really arbitrary examples.
#       'Invalid login to Jenkins by user mooh by IP \'<HOST>\'',
#       'Forced entry trial by <HOST>',
#     ],
#   }
#
#
# @param failregexes
#   List of regular expressions that will be run against new log lines as they
#   reach fail2ban. The regular expressions follow the Python regular
#   expression format, and there are some special patterns that fail2ban can
#   use. See the jail.conf(5) man page for more details. Each item in the list
#   is placed on its own line. Lines starting with the second one are prepended
#   with spaces so that the regular expressions line up with the beginning of
#   the first one.
# @param ensure
#   Whether the resources should be installed or removed.
# @param ignoreregexes
#   List of Python regular expressions that should prevent a log line from
#   being considered for banning. If a line matches regular expressions
#   contained in this parameter, they are ignored even though they would have
#   matched a failregex. Each item in the list is placed on its own line. Lines
#   starting with the second one are prepended with spaces so that the regular
#   expressions line up with the beginning of the first one.
# @param includes
#   List of files to include before considering the rest of the filter
#   definition. These files can declare variables used by the filter to set
#   default behaviours.
# @param includes_after
#   List of files to include after filter definition.
# @param additional_defs
#   List of arbitrary lines that should appear at the begining of the filter's
#   definition section, for anything that didn't fit in other parameters. Each
#   item in the list is output on its own line in the filter file. No syntax
#   checking is done.
