## Module description

This module helps you run Tor relays by installing, configuring, and managing
Tor service instances.


## Usage

The main `tor` class manages the installation options.

The `tor::instance` type manages a Tor instance configuration.


### Beginning with `tor`

You must first include the main class with: `include ::tor`, then you can
create an instance with:

```puppet
tor::instance { 'foo':
  settings => {
    Nickname => 'foo',
    OrPort   => 9050,
    DirPort  => 9030,
  }
}
```

The `instances` parameters of the main class, will be passed to
`create_resources`.

You may put you configuration options in hiera:

```yaml
---
tor::instances:
  foo:
    settings:
      Nickname: 'foo'
      OrPort: 9050
      DirPort: 9030
```
