/*
    krt_prefsrc defines the source address for outgoing connections.
    On Linux, this causes the "src" attribute of a route to be set.

    Without this option outgoing connections would use the peering IP which
    would cause packet loss if some peering disconnects but the interface
    is still available. (The route would still exist and thus route through
    the TUN/TAP interface but the VPN daemon would simply drop the packet.)
